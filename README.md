# Datalix API
This is a small, but handy library usable to manage your Datalix service.

# Usage
This really isn't big enough to write a whole wiki for.

All you need to do is get yourself an instance of the `DatalixApiService` class, which takes only one string argument in it's constructor - the access token to Datalix's API.

Every other method takes a Service ID (Product ID) as the first argument.
